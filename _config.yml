  Hi, my name's Aman Singh and I'm a goal oriented Data Scientist with demonstrated ability to deliver valuable insights via data science and analytics; and develop and entire AI based solution around it. 
  I would like to be a jack of all trade. I develop interests and hobbies that keep changing from season to season. Sometimes I feel I'll end up being a dilettante of many areas.  
  
  I have worked with a range of different libraries and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new.
